# Weekly Summary:

## Previous week take home message:
- fixed mini project 2 so that it runs smoothly in the command prompt
- understand briefly how neural networks work
- try to understand issues with visual studio, failed.

## What was done this week
- Played around with neural network in ann_expl.py, understood more of what weights mean and and how hyperparameters effect weights. 
- Completed mini project 2, not fully correctly but understood more of neural network
## Scientific project, advancement:
- More basic research on how implementing code works in Assetto Corsa, spent more time understanding the neural network as it will likely be used to simulate driver behavior in the model.

# TODO for next week:

- Mini project 2 final touches:
  + add figure using \includegraphics
  + reference algorithm and figure using \label and \ref
