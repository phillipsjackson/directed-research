  + return simulation metrics: 
    + number of steps,
    + max size of the queue (need to pass the result sthorugh list)
    + ...
  + plot the results : you can use boxplot for exemple, wher eyou show, for each environment size, the size of the queue (you can use [matplolib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/stats/boxplot_plot.html) for exeample to do the boxplot)
  + add the plots to the latex of the miniproject, describe what you see on the plots, upload the pdf on canvas.
