# Weekly Summary:

## Previous week take home message:
- implemented exploration of the algorithm performance and measurements and graphing
- went through research proposal draft, fixed latex issues and formatting/ citations

## What was done this week
- finished research proposal
- added vacuum world experiment replication and graphing 
-added latex algorithmic explanation
- read a bit of trustworthy AI
## Scientific project, advancement:
- switched from rFacror2 to Assetto Corsa for research project, runs better and uses python


# TODO for next week:
- Mini project 2:
  + What are neural network?  Play and use  `mini_project_2/ann_expl.py` to illustrate your eplanation
  + Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbGu60QBx2o
  + Can we explain what the 'weights' are doing in the neural network? document that on the Latex document
  + Write Latex report (with plots): 
    -> focus on simple, complete explainations 
    -> a few words on neural network in general
- Readings 
  + Paper on complexity
  + Paper on Trustworthy AI
  + Slides on Trustworthy AI
