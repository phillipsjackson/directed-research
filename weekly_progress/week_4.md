# Weekly Summary:

## Previous week take home message:
- implemented exploration of the algorithm performance and measurements and graphing
- went through research proposal draft, fixed latex issues and formatting/ citations

## What was done this week
- finished research proposal
- added vacuum world experiment replication and graphing 
-added latex algorithmic explanation
- read a bit of trustworthy AI
## Scientific project, advancement:
- switched from rFacror2 to Assetto Corsa for research project, runs better and uses python


# TODO for next week:

- (finish research proposal)
- Read comments on Canvas and issues on github
- Modify the script of miin-project 1 to generate 10 (or hundreds?) of experiments replicate:
  + grid size increases
  + return simulation metrics: 
    + number of steps,
    + max size of the queue (need to pass the result sthorugh list)
    + ...
  + plot the results : you can use boxplot for exemple, wher eyou show, for each environment size, the size of the queue (you can use [matplolib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/stats/boxplot_plot.html) for exeample to do the boxplot)
  + add the plots to the latex of the miniproject, describe what you see on the plots, upload the pdf on canvas.
- Trustworthy AI: Read suggested reading
- Research project: research on rFactor2
  + config needed
  + mod capacity
  + ...
