\section{I.	Introduction}

Background: With New Regulations coming into Formula One in 2026, it is highly likely that the optimal racing line for most tracks will change slightly. The cars will be lighter, have a new DRS (Drag-Reduction System), and will all around react differently than they would have with the previous regulations. 

Literature Review: Every Formula One team conducts their own research daily, using telemetry-based simulations to find out optimal racing lines for their car but plenty of independent study has been done as well. The obvious inconsistencies in these previously published studies are that they are not including the new regulations and the data they found will likely become obsolete. It is estimated currently that the cars will have around 30\% less downforce and 55\% less drag resulting in potential extreme differences in braking and cornering strategy. The cars will also now have an active aerodynamics system (X-mode for low drag; Z-mode for downforce), rather than a manual one like previously (DRS on DRS off).

The cars will also now have an active aerodynamics system (X-mode for low drag; Z-mode for downforce), rather than a manual one like previously (DRS on DRS off). [Reference Lawrence Baretto article from F1] Previous research has been done on optimization and racing line specifically from companies like AWS who are incorporating AI to give real time feedback and data to viewers during races but even their data will be skewed next season with new regulations. 

Research Question and Hypothesis: The newly regulated cars are projected to be able to corner faster and sharper than previous years. Using data from previously regulated cars a fairly exact racing line has been created for each car. These racing lines previously did not differ much year to year nearly as much as they are predicted to this year. The main questions of this project are to select a specific corner from a track and see how wheel to wheel racing and overtaking can be changed and lead to more possibilties under the new regulations. It is expected that the racing line will rely less on straight line speed and braking and more on carrying speed through corners resulting in much longer battles and brand new areas for overtaking.


\subsection{II. Methodology}

Algorithms: The model will require lots of algorithms in order to become realistic enought to provide feeback but most of these algorithms should be built in to the simulator itself. Aerodynamics, multi-body dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, wake effects, motion control, and force feedback will all be included. 2 reinforcement learning models will need to be used to mod and train AI agents to control a vehicle and race each other from varying positions and speeds around a given corner. Observation space and and action space will give the agent information of the environment and what it can do with some sort of reward function relating to overtaking the other car or defending against the other car.

Data Extraction/ Platform Use: The FIA releases official classification pdfs including tire usage, sector times and fastest laps after every session which could be used. OpenF1 API and FastF1 are both community driven unofficial telemetry APIs which could have valuable data as well. In terms of simulators, rFactor 2 has the most possibilties for creating a mod and AI agents as the community is very strong having published downloaded mods such as a prototype 2026 regulated car. rFactor 2 allows for easy integration of reinforcement models and already has numerous amounts of highly realistic feedback options that will provide stronoger infromation back to the reinforcement model.  Python will be used for the text editing of these models.

Statistical Analysis/ Algorithms Exploration: Testing the model will include a lot of sending the car into corners at different speeds and from different angles to see how wheel-to-wheel racing could be tighter and go on for longer through corners. These will also be used with the reinforcement model to see how the two drivers may battle within a given corner and the model will continue to learn from itself to test the limits of the new more agile cars. Running the simulator with two cars in a continuous reinforcement model using neural networks to learn from itself should allow for optimization to occur over the course of time. 

Ethical Considerations: Ethical considerations of this project are that in theory by creating a perfect simulator, an agent created by AI could possibly become a better driver than a Formula 1 driver, leaving people with dissatisfaction towards weaker drivers not getting the maximum potential out of their car. It's rather unlikely however that this becomes an issue as most drivers are still better at adapting to changing track conditions and weather than an AI agent is.


\subsection{III. Expected Outcomes and Implications}

The expected outcome of this model will be a simulation in which the cars are able to maneuver much quicker than before through corners and also see large differences in cornering strategy and wheel-to-wheel racing. A typical battle between two drivers coming into a corner off of a straight should not result in whichever driver brakes later winning the corner and taking the position. The cars should be able to battle further into the corner and positioning and speed-carrying should matter more than simply braking. The simulation should show more possibilities for drivers to take less optimal racing lines in order to get better position throughout the entire corner. Overtaking on corners that were not previously thought possible to make a move into should also be seen. It is expected that the model shows a slight decrease in overtaking on straights and a significant increase in overtaking in corners.

\subsection {IV. Timeline}

Splitting the project up into 15 weeks, weeks 1-3 should be about creating a proposal and model to then figure out what the best and most accessible tools are to use. Weeks 4-6 should be about tweaking and perfecting the model so tests will show useful data. Weeks 7-12 should include running the program and finding results to test further to start seeing the implied results of the program. Finally, Weeks 13-15 should be about gathering the results, breaking them down into how they could be used in Formula One, and hopefully publishing them.
